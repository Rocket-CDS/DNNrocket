# Simplisity

Simplisity is a client side jQuery based framework and a set of Server side utilities. The idea is to keep things as simple and flexible as possible.  

Simplisity is designed to take data from the html page, pass it to a server side API for processing, which then can return data or html to be added to the html page. Simplisity currently uses JQuery to ensure "simplicity".
